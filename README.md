This project allows you to create a clean, professional and ATS Optimized Resume in PDF format right from GitHub, without any local setup!

## ⭐ ATS Optimizations:
- **Unique Action Verbs** – All bullet points start with unique action verbs.
- **Quantifiable Impact** – Most points show measurable quantitative results.
- **Standard Fonts** – Uses CMU (Computer Modern Unicode), a widely accepted scientific standard.
- **Reverse Chronological Order** – Most recent job first.
- **Standard Sections** – Skills, Work Experience, Education etc.
- **No Fancy Formatting** – No columns, text boxes, tables, or graphics, as ATS struggles to read them.
- **PDF Format** – Maintains consistency and ensures compatibility.
- **Keyword Optimization** – Includes job-relevant keywords at the top.
- **No Headers or Footers** – Some ATS ignore or misread them.
- **Simple Bullet Points** – Uses simple and consistent `•` for points, avoids special characters.
- **No Images & Logos** – ATS reads text only.
- **No Personal Info** – Excludes unnecessary personal details that might be flagged by ATS.
- **External Links** – Clearly highlights links for contact details (email, phone, website, etc.) and external projects.
- **Length** – Does not exceed 2 pages in standard PDF.
- **Acronyms** – Uncommon acronyms are spelled out (e.g., SEO (Search Engine Optimization)) for keyword matching.

## 🚀 Why LaTeX?

Unlike traditional word processors, LaTeX is not WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). Instead, it relies on a markup-based approach, ensuring precise, structured, and consistent formatting. This allows you to focus on your content while maintaining a polished and professional layout every time.

LaTeX provides a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.
